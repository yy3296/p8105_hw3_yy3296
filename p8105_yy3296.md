### Problem 1

#### Read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_yy3296_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

### Problem 2

I load the accel dataset and tidy the data, including transform
Monday-Sunday to Weekday or Weekend, and encode data with reasonable
variable classes.

``` r
clean_accel_data =
  read_csv("./dataset/accel_data (3).csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_weekend = ifelse((day == "Monday"| day == "Tuesday"|day == "Wednesday"|day == "Thursday"| day == "Friday"), "Weekday", "Weekend")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity_minutes",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity_counts") 
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

-   Distribution
    -   There are 6 variables in the dataset, which are week, day_id,
        day, weekday_weekend, activity_minutes, activity_counts.
    -   There are 50400 observations exists in the dataset.

I aggregate across minutes to create a new variable clalled
activity_whole_day to show the total activity for each day, and then I
create a table showing these totals.

``` r
clean_accel_data %>%
  group_by(week, day) %>%
  summarize(activity_whole_day = sum(activity_counts)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

-   I don’t think there are any trends apparent.

I make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses
for each day and use color to indicate day of the week.

``` r
clean_accel_data %>%
  mutate(activity_minutes = as.integer(activity_minutes)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = activity_minutes, y = activity_counts, color = day)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + labs(x = "activity minutes", y = "activity counts", title = "24-hour activity time courses for each day") + 
scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(0, 1440, 120))
```

<img src="p8105_yy3296_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

-   Distribution
    -   For this plot, we can see the largest data appears between
        1080th and 1200th minutes, and the smalles data appears before
        about 300th mimutes.

### Problem 3

load the data from the p8105.datasets

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

-   For this dataset, the size is 2595176 rows \* 7 columns.
-   All the variables are id, date, prcp, snow, snwd, tmax, tmin.
-   This dataset lost a large number of data which means there are lots
    of NA in this data.

I do some data cleaning, and create separate variables for year, month,
and day, and ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and
snowfall are given in reasonable units.

``` r
clean_ny_noaa = 
  ny_noaa %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(prcp = prcp/10,
         snow = snow/100,
         tmax = as.integer(tmax)/10,
         tmin = as.integer(tmin)/10) %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-")
```

Find what are the most commonly observed values in snowfall.

``` r
clean_ny_noaa %>%
  count(snow)
```

    ## # A tibble: 282 × 2
    ##     snow       n
    ##    <dbl>   <int>
    ##  1 -0.13       1
    ##  2  0    2008508
    ##  3  0.03    8790
    ##  4  0.05    9748
    ##  5  0.08    9962
    ##  6  0.1     5106
    ##  7  0.13   23095
    ##  8  0.15    3672
    ##  9  0.18    3226
    ## 10  0.2     4797
    ## # … with 272 more rows

By the result, we can see 0 is the most commonly observed values. Since
n represent the frequency of each values, and we can see the time of 0
appear is far outweighs than other values.

I make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January
and in July in each station across years.

``` r
clean_ny_noaa %>%
  filter(month %in% c("01", "07")) %>%
  group_by(id, month, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax, color = id)) + 
  geom_point(size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_path(alpha =  0.5) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "average max temperature", tile = "Average max temperature in January and in July in each station across years") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ month)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'id', 'month'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.
    ## geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust
    ## the group aesthetic?
    ## geom_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust
    ## the group aesthetic?

<img src="p8105_yy3296_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

-   Distribution
    -   By this plot, we can see that the overall temperature of July is
        higher than the overall temperature of January, and the
        temperature of July is about ten degrees higher than the
        temperature of January.
    -   There are some outliers both for January and July. For example,
        for January 1982, the lowest temperature is lower than -10; for
        July 2004, the lowest temperature is lower than 20.

I make a two-panel plot showing tmax vs tmin for the full dataset.

``` r
clean_ny_noaa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmax, y = tmin)) + geom_hex()  +
  labs(title = "Tmax vs Tmin for the Full Dataset",x = "Tmax vs Tmin",y = "Temperature")
```

<img src="p8105_yy3296_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="90%" />

I make a plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0
and less than 100 separately by year.

``` r
clean_ny_noaa %>% 
  filter(snow > 0 & snow <100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = snow)) + geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Snowfall", y = "Snowfall values", title = "The Distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less than 100 separately by year")
```

<img src="p8105_yy3296_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="90%" />
